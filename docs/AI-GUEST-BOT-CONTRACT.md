# AI Guest Bot — CONTINUUM-Grounded Contract (the shared seam)

> **Audience:** both terminals — the **Pod-Geni** team (owns the orchestrator +
> `/v1/sessions/start` dispatch) and the **CONTINUUM/AMF** team (owns the corpus + the
> honesty gate). Build the bot **once**, to this contract, so it grounds on CONTINUUM and
> either product can run it.
>
> **Status:** spec (the bot runtime is net-new — `AI_GUEST_BOT_URL` is currently unset).
> **Honest scope (P4):** groundedness here is *retrieval-based* — "traceable to an
> Observation," not a semantic truth-judge. It tightens when vector retrieval is exposed
> (V0.5 hybrid backend); the seam below does not change when it does.

## 0. The principle

The bot is a **conversational shell** with a **swappable grounding brain**. The shell
(join call → STT → LLM → TTS → speak) is product-agnostic. The brain is a `CorpusAdapter`.
Pod-Geni ships a default adapter (its own corpus); CONTINUUM ships one backed by a tenant's
Observations + the Brand Kernel gate. **Same shell, same contract, different adapter.**

```

## 1. The `CorpusAdapter` interface (the swap point)

Both products implement this; the bot depends only on it.

```ts
interface GroundedPassage {
  observationId: string;   // stable citation handle
  text: string;            // the passage the bot may use
  score: number;           // retrieval confidence (higher = better)
  source?: string;         // 'git' | 'docs' | 'brand' | ... (provenance)
}

interface ClaimVerdict {
  claim: string;
  grounded: boolean;       // traceable to a corpus passage above threshold?
  supportingIds: string[]; // Observation IDs that support it (empty if ungrounded)
  score: number;
}

interface CorpusAdapter {
  /** Session warm-up: pre-load the most relevant corpus for this topic so the
   *  per-turn loop rarely needs a network hop. Returns the seed grounding context. */
  prime(topic: string, k: number): Promise<GroundedPassage[]>;

  /** Per-turn retrieval (only when the primed context is insufficient). */
  retrieve(query: string, k: number): Promise<GroundedPassage[]>;

  /** Post-turn / post-session: flag AI claims not traceable to the corpus. */
  checkClaims(claims: string[]): Promise<ClaimVerdict[]>;
}
```

### 1a. `ContinuumCorpusAdapter` (CONTINUUM/AMF owns)

Backed by the shipped MCP tools against a tenant-scoped engine connection:

| Adapter method | CONTINUUM call | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `prime(topic,k)` | `continuum_search_docs(topic, k)` → `continuum_get_observations(ids)` | full passages + IDs, loaded into bot context at `sessions/start` |
| `retrieve(q,k)` | `continuum_search_docs(q, k)` (+ `get_observations` for the winners) | Layer-1 → Layer-3 on demand |
| `checkClaims(claims)` | per claim: `continuum_search_docs(claim, 3)`; `grounded = topScore ≥ THRESHOLD`; `supportingIds = hit ids`. Optionally `continuum_check_brand(claim)` to also catch **promise/position contradictions**. | retrieval-grounded now; semantic when vector search is exposed |

Connection: `CONTINUUM_HTTP_URL` + tenant `CONTINUUM_HTTP_TOKEN` (one tenant = one brand's
corpus). The `corpusRef` in the session contract (§2) carries the tenant.

### 1b. `PodGeniCorpusAdapter` (Pod-Geni's existing default)
Wraps the current `corpusDocPath` grounding + `AiUngroundedClaim` flagging. Kept so AI
Guest works standalone; CONTINUUM is the preferred adapter for brand-honest grounding.

## 2. Session contract — `POST {AI_GUEST_BOT_URL}/v1/sessions/start`

Extends Pod-Geni's existing dispatch with an explicit `corpusRef` (replaces the bare
`corpusDocPath`, so grounding can be CONTINUUM-backed):

```jsonc
// request
{
  "sessionId": "string",
  "podcastId": "string",
  "roomUrl": "https://<daily-room>",
  "voiceProfileId": "string",          // resolves the VoxCPM2 voice
  "persona": "string",                 // e.g. "Sharp and skeptical Series-B VC"
  "corpusRef": {
    "adapter": "continuum" | "podgeni",
    "tenant": "brand-riaan",           // continuum: tenant id (the corpus)
    "docPath": null                    // podgeni: legacy corpusDocPath
  },
  "grounding": {
    "threshold": 0.0,                  // min retrieval score to count as "grounded"
    "primeTopic": "string",            // warm-up topic for CorpusAdapter.prime()
    "primeK": 12,
    "checkMode": "per_turn" | "post_session"  // when to run checkClaims()
  },
  "callbackUrl": "string"              // bot → orchestrator status/events
}

// 202 response
{ "sessionId": "string", "state": "joining", "botParticipantId": "string" }
```

**Secrets are NEVER in this payload** (P1): the bot reads `CONTINUUM_HTTP_TOKEN`,
`DAILY_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, `VOXCPM2_*`, LLM key from its own environment.

Lifecycle events to `callbackUrl`: `joined`, `turn` (each AI turn + citations + flags),
`left`, `error`.

## 3. The STT → LLM → TTS turn loop (latency-budgeted)

Real-time conversation needs the loop tight. Target **< 1.2s** from user-stop to bot-speech-start.

1. **STT (Deepgram, streaming).** VAD + endpointing detect end-of-user-turn. Use interim
   results to *pre-warm* retrieval; commit on the finalized transcript.
2. **Ground (mostly free).** Answer from the **primed** context (loaded at `sessions/start`).
   Only call `retrieve()` when the turn clearly leaves the primed topic — that network hop
   is the main latency risk, so make it the exception, not the rule.
3. **LLM turn.** System prompt = persona + grounding rules (§4) + cited primed passages +
   recent transcript. Output: the spoken answer **plus the list of factual claims it made**
   (structured), each tagged with the `observationId`(s) it leaned on.
4. **TTS (VoxCPM2, streaming).** Stream the first sentence to audio while the rest generates.
5. **Speak** into the Daily room. Handle **barge-in**: if the user starts talking, stop TTS
   and yield (the interviewer never talks over the host).
6. **Check (async, off the hot path).** Run `checkClaims()` per `grounding.checkMode`.
   `per_turn` = flag during the call (the bot can self-correct: "I should caveat that — I
   can't ground it"); `post_session` = Pod-Geni's current behaviour (flag in review).

**Turn-taking:** the bot is an *interviewer/co-host*, not a monologuist — short turns, one
question at a time, always yields to the host. Cap bot turn length; prefer a question over
a statement when grounding is thin.

## 4. The grounding prompt (the honesty rule, in the system prompt)

Non-negotiable instructions to the LLM:

- **Answer from the provided passages.** Each passage carries an `observationId`; when you
  assert a fact, it must trace to one.
- **If you cannot ground a claim, do not assert it.** Ask a question instead, or say plainly
  you can't speak to it. (This mirrors the brand `emotional_contract`: "what I claim is
  built or I tell you it isn't yet.")
- **Emit your factual claims as a structured list** with the `observationId`(s) each rests
  on, so `checkClaims()` can verify them. An empty `supportingIds` from the check = the turn
  gets flagged (and, in `per_turn` mode, the bot caveats it aloud).

This makes the live conversation obey the same **verify-then-dissolve** discipline as the
written content engine: a claim survives only while it's traceable to a verified Observation.

## 5. Transcript + citation schema

AI turns land on the same path as humans (`role:'ai_guest'`), enriched:

```jsonc
{
  "role": "ai_guest",
  "sessionId": "string",
  "text": "string",
  "tStart": 0.0, "tEnd": 0.0,              // for word-sync / later editing
  "citations": [{ "observationId": "string", "score": 0.0 }],
  "ungroundedFlags": [{ "claim": "string", "reason": "no traceable Observation" }]
}
```

Downstream (the content engine) reads this transcript as **capture** — the grounded,
flagged Q&A is higher-signal raw material than a solo monologue.

## 6. Acceptance smoke (verify-then-dissolve on the bot itself)

`node examples/ai-guest-smoke.mjs` → green when:
1. `sessions/start` with `corpusRef.adapter:'continuum', tenant:'brand-riaan'` → bot joins a
   Daily room (or a mock transport in CI).
2. A scripted host turn on a topic **in** the corpus → the bot answers **with ≥1 citation**
   (a real Observation ID from the tenant).
3. A scripted host turn on a topic **absent** from the corpus → the bot **refuses to assert**
   and `checkClaims()` flags any slip with `grounded:false`.
4. Barge-in mid-TTS → the bot stops within 300ms.
5. Every AI turn is emitted on the transcript path with `citations`/`ungroundedFlags` present.

## 7. Honest caveats (don't oversell)
- **Groundedness is retrieval-based** (keyword/FTS5 now; vector when the hybrid backend's
  search is exposed). It proves *traceability*, not *truth*. State that to stakeholders.
- **Latency is the real risk.** Pre-priming + async checks are how the loop stays < 1.2s;
  a naive per-turn MCP round-trip will feel laggy. Build the priming first.
- **The bot is net-new.** Unlike the VC avatar half, nothing here is proven yet — this spec
  is the contract to build to, not a description of working code.
